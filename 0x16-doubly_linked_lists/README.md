# 0x16. C - Doubly linked lists

## Project Goals

Learn how to use doubly linked lists with C. Doubly linked lists consist of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields (links), that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes.

#### 0. Print list
A function that prints all the elements of a ```dlistint_t``` list.

#### 1. List length
A function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlist_t list.

#### 2. Add node
A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.

#### 3. Add node at the end
A function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.

#### 4. Free list
A function that frees a dlistint_t list.

#### 5. Get node at index
A function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.

#### 6. Sum list
A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.

#### 7. Insert at index
A function that inserts a new node at a given position.

#### 8. Delete at index
A function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
