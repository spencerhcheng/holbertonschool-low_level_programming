### 0x01A. Sorting algorithms & Big O

#### Synopsis
The objective of this project is to gain familiarity with different types of sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are mostly used for placing elements of a list in a certain order; primarily in numerical or lexicographical order.

Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms, such as searing or merging data.

Through this project, we will also be exposed to the concept of time complexity, space complexity and Big O notation.

Sorting algorithms explored:
* [] - Bubble sort
* [] - Insertion sort
* [] - Selection sort
* [] - Quick sort
