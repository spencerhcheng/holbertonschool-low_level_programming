![SEARCH_ALGOS](http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2014/08/map-local-search-ss-1920-800x450.jpg)

#### Synopsis
The objective of this project is to gain familiarity with different types of search algorithms. 


A search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the Search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain. Examples of such structures include but are not limited to a Linked List, an Array data structure, or a Search tree. The appropriate search algorithm often depends on the data structure being searched, but also on any a priori knowledge about the data.

Through this project, we will also delve deeper into thinking about space complexity.

Sorting algorithms explored:
* [] - Binary search
* [] - Linear search

#### FILE SETUP
All files are written and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Programs will be compiled using gcc 4.8.4 (C90) using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic. All files will end with a new line.

Code will use Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
